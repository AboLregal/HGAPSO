# HGAPSO
MatLab Optimzation Code : The Idea of this Algorithm  first we generate random solutions  

then we start the first part of iteration GA and compare GA results with PSO results and choose best  

these solution go to PSO Algorithm and create new solution and compare the new solutios with GA and choose best  and so on like Cuckoo algorithm ( CA )
